# Intro to Node.js

## What is Node

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Up until a few years ago all the javascript that you wrote had to run in the browser. It was the only place for you to execute javascript code and that meant that all javascript that you wrote was only front end code.

So Node is wasy for us to write JS code on the server side.
