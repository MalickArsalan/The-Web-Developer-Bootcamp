* Run a file with node (node < filename >)

## Interact with Node Console (node)

Node has its own version of the console and it's a little bit different because it's all based in the command line. We don't get the nice browser interface. So the node console is just a place that we can open in our terminal with a simple command and then we can start typing javascript commands and they'll be executed just like they are in the browser.

We can open it up by typing the command node in terminal. REPL -> READ EVALUATE PRINT LOOP
To quit, I can type Ctrl + C twice.

## Run a file with node

So what I mean by saying run a file with node is that we can create a javascript file.
Call it whatever you want and fill it with javascript code and then we can execute it in the command  without browser ,HTML and CSS.

To use it
We just write node < filename >
