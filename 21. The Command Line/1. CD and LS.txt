Navigating Files and Folder 

1. ls -> List
    It just show me all the files and folders of current folder.
    Example:
        ls
        ls "Directory Name" -> Show list inside that directory

2. CD -> Change Directories
    cd "Name of the folder or directory" that we want to change into.
    Example:
        cd "20. Backend Basics"
        cd .. -> To go one folder back
