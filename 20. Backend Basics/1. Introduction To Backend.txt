1. How Internet Works
    a. When we enter url, like http://www.udemy.com/courses. There are few things that happened behind the scenes
        i. Finding the Right Address
            1. Your query is submitted to your ISP
            2. Within your ISP, the DNS takes the Domain name and turns it into an IP address, which is the unique locator for Udemy server.

        ii. Going to that Address
            1. A request is sent to the desired IP address via HTTP.
            2. Your request finds the fastest path possible path to the server with specefied IP.
            3. This is not a direct journey. It requires hoping from server to server until we arrive.
        
        iii. Udemy Server Responds
            1. The requested server figures out exactly what we are asking for(/courses)
            2. The server builds us the right content, often pulling informationfrom database
            3. The server responds with any combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            40And the... it gets to a browser whose job is to render the page.

2. Static VS Dynamic Web Pages
    a. Dynamic Web Pages
        These are sites that are compiled on the server side where the server is pulling together or 
        constructing a web page before it's sent back as a response.
    
3. A Generic Stack
    Stack -> Stack is a term that's usedto refer to all of the technologies tha a particular web application uses.
    FrontEnd Technologies ->  HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    BackEnd Technologies -> Different languages can be used to write server side codding such as:
