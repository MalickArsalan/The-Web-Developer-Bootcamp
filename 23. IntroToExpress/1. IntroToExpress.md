* What is a framework? How is it differen from a library?
The most important difference and in fact the defining difference between a library and a framework is something called inversion of control.
What does this mean? Well, it means that when you call a library, you are in control. But with a framework that control is inverted: The framework calls you.
Basically all the control flow is already in the framework and there's just a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with your own code.
A library on the other hand is a collection of functionality that you can call.
