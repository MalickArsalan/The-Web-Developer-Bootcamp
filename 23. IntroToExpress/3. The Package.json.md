# NPM Init and Package.json

* Ose the `--save` flag to install packages
When we install a package with NPM install and we add on this flag at the end `--save` it will take the package name and version and automatically save it into our package.josn file if we have one.

* Explain what the package.json file does
This file can contain a lot of meta-data about your project. But mostly it will be used for below things:
  * lists the packages your project depends on
  * Specifies versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules
  * Makes your build reproducible, and therefore easier to share with other developers

* Use `npm init` to create a new package.json
