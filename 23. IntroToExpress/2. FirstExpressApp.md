# Our First Express App

* Review HTTP response/request lifecycle
when I go to a url like Google.com and I hit Enter I'm asking for a web page, I send an HTTP request and that request has a particular verb or type. Is it a GET request or a POST request or some of the other ones we haven't really seen yet.
And then I potentially send some data along with the request and the server that receives my request. The server that I'm requesting Google has some code that decides what page to send me back. So it sends me that Google home page or maybe it sends me the Google logon page or the G-mail page or a page says My password is incorrect whatever it is. The server is deciding what to send back.
So I send a request server side code figures out what I'm asking for and then it does some stuff and then send feedback a response that is fundamentally what we're going to use Express to do.
