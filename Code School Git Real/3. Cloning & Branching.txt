Cloning A Repository

1. git clone <URL> -> This will create a folder of the same name, that of your repo
URL -> URL of the reote repository

2. git clone <URL> <Folder Name>
Folder Name -> the name that you want to set for local folder

Git Clone -> What does Git Clone do?
 
	a. Download the entire repository into a new git-real directory.
	b. Adds the "origin" remote pointing it to the clone URL.
	c. Checks out initial branch(likely master). And Sets the HEAD


Branching Out

Working On A Branch
5. echo "Sample text" > cat.txt	// This will create a file and write follwoing text "Sample text"
$ git commit -m "Create quantum cat."

Note:	Now this commit will add to our new branch time line
		$ ls -> here at new branch time line we can see "cat.txt" file

Back To Master
$ git checkout master
$ ls 
Note: Now in master time Line we can not see "cat.txt" through ls command
$ git log 
Note: Same you will not see "Quantum cat commit" there

Time To Merge
$ git checkout master 
$ ls
6. git merge <Branch Name> //merge brings one branch changes into another
Following message will appear
Message: Fast-Forward	-> 


Fast-Forward To The Future
Condtion to dast-forward merge
* If we create a branch and make one commit or several and do nothing  on other branch
it'same very easu for Git to merge the cat branch back into master because nothing was
modified in the meantime.
