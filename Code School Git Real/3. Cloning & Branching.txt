1. git clone <URL> -> This will create a folder of the same name, that of your repo
URL -> URL of the reote repository

2. git clone <URL> <Folder Name>
Folder Name -> the name that you want to set for local folder

Git Clone -> What does Git Clone do?
 
	a. Download the entire repository into a new git-real directory.
	b. Adds the "origin" remote pointing it to the clone URL.
	c. Checks out initial branch(likely master). And Sets the HEAD

Working On A Branch
5. echo "Sample text" > cat.txt	// This will create a file and write follwoing text "Sample text"
$ git commit -m "Create quantum cat."

Note:	Now this commit will add to our new branch time line
		$ ls -> here at new branch time line we can see "cat.txt" file

Back To Master
$ git checkout master
$ ls 
Note: Now in master time Line we can not see "cat.txt" through ls command
$ git log 
Note: Same you will not see "Quantum cat commit" there
