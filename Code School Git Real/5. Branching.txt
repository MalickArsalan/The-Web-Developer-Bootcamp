Remote Branches & Tags

Why Create A Remote Branch?
1. When you need other people to work on your branch.
2. It is a good, practice, If you are working on a branch that is going to last longer than a day,
   you might want to back it up, and can do so by making it a remote branch and pushing it to GitHub.

Creating a Remote Branch
1. git checkout -b "ABL-PAK-18-01"
// Switched	to new branch 'ABL-PAK-18-01'
2. git push origin "ABL-PAK-18-01"
// Doing so it links local branch to the remote branch(tracking)

Pushing To The Branch	
1. git add ExportBLL.cs
2. git commit -a -m "Add ExportBLL"
3. git push
//	We push because it is a tracking branch, it knows to push the local shopping cart branch to the remote
	to the remote shopping cart branch.
	
Creating a Remote Branch
3. Now May be Talha tell me "Hey, Arsalan, I created the remote branch for 'ABL-PAK-18-01', go ahead and grab it."

Pulling New Branches 
1. git pull
// It's going to show to Arsalan in the output that we have new remote branch called 'ABL-PAK-18-01'.
2. git branch
// this will not show 'ABL-PAK-18-01' in local branch.
3. git branch -r
// Now Arsalan is able do see all remote branches.
4. git checkout 'ABL-PAK-18-01'
// To start working on the branch, and it's automatically set up as a tracking remote branch. 
   So now Arsalan can make changes and push to that remote branch 
   
Remote Show
1. git remote show origin
// origin is our remote name.
// This will show us all of our remote branches and whether they are tracked or not.
// It'll show us all the local branches and which remote branches they merge with.
// Lastly it will all the local branches configured for when we do a git push.
// Even it goes out to the server and check to see if any our local branches are out of the date,


Removing A Branch
1. git push origin :ABL-PAK-18-01
// Only delete remote branches
2. git branch -d "ABL-PAK-18-01"
// it will not let us to delete that local branch.
3. git branch -D "ABL-PAK-18-01"  

On deleted Remote Branch
1. git commit -m -a "Some other work"
// Talha committed new changes at local "ABL-PAK-18-01" branch
2. git push
// Nothing will happened
// No Remote to push to(it's just a local branch now)
3. git remote show origin
// Talha found that shopping cart branch is stale, somebody has deleted it
4. git remote prune origin
// clean up deleted remote branches.
