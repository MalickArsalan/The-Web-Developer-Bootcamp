Remote Branches & Tags

Why Create A Remote Branch?
1. When you need other people to work on your branch.
2. It is also a good practice, if you are working on a branch that is going to last longer then a day, 
you might want to back it up, and you can do so by making it a remote branch and pushing it to GitHub.
